This is a "radar" that I made using a raspberry pi 4 b, and ultrasonic rangefinder, and a servo. The "radar" HUD is displayed on the screen using the pygame library. At each servo position, the rangefinder measures the distance and then displays a dot based on the distance of whatever is detected within 100cm.
